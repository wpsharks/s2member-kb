This Knowledge Base Article covers configuring *Restriction Options* for *s2Member*. It is important to note that you can successfully protect content on your *WordPress* site without touching the *Restriction Options* panel. You can easily restrict access to **Posts** and **Pages** using the *s2Member* meta box on the **Post** and **Page** editing panels.

This article is part of the [s2Member User's Guide](http://s2member.com/kb/kb-tag/s2member-users-guide/), a series of articles that cover the fundamentals of using *s2Member*.

You use the *Restriction Options* panel ( **WordPress Dashboard → s2Member → Restriction Options**) to configure more complex restrictions for your site. These include:

- restricting access to multiple **Posts** and **Pages**
- restricting access to feeds, search results, and navigation menus
- protecting your site from Brute Force attacks and other IP-based restrictions
- using conditionals (like the `[s2If]` shortcode) to protect only parts of a **Post** or **Page**.

The *s2Member* panels discussed in this article are: 

- Post Access Restrictions 
- Page Access Restrictions
- Tag Access Restrictions
- Category Access Restrictions
- URI Restrictions (Typical w/BuddyPress)
- Alternative View Protection (feeds, search results, etc..)
- Simple Shortcode Conditionals (protect only parts of your content)
- Specific Post/Page Access Restrictions
- Brute Force IP/Login Restrictions
- Unique IP Access Restrictions
-  Simultaneous Login Restrictions

## Post Access Restrictions

Here you can specify **Posts** that are restricted to certain *Membership Access Levels*. *s2Member* also supports **Custom Post Types** here. If you have a theme or plugin installed that has enabled **[Custom Post Types](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types)** you can put the IDs for those **Posts** here as well.

### Restricting by Post IDs and Custom Post Types

Enter *Post IDs*  in comma-delimited format into the text box below the level required for access. Example: `1,2,3,84,8,21`. Or you can type: `all` to protect all **Posts** of any type. You can also restrict access to all **Posts** of a specific **Post Type**. For example, `1,2,3,all-newspapers` protects several **Post IDs** and all **Posts** of type: newspaper.

![post-restrictions](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9320495/15324570/024b74c0-1c15-11e6-89bd-c926e647bb7e.jpg)

Tip: Can't find your Post IDs? Get [WP Show IDs](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-show-ids/)

Protecting individual **Posts** only protects the *Permalinks*  for those **Posts**. It is still possible for excerpts of protected content to be seen in search results generated by *WordPress*, feeds, and **Archive** views including your *Home Page*, inside a **Category** or **Tag** listing, or through other queries formulated by your theme. 

This is the intended functionality. Excerpts are an excellent way to "tease" public visitors. In other words, public visitors may have access to excerpts introduced by your theme but any attempt to view the full **Post** (via the *Permalink*) results in an automatic redirect to your *Membership Options Page*.

**Note**: If you would like to protect many **Posts** at once (including **Archive** views), you can use *Category Level Restrictions*,  *Tag Level Restrictions*, or use s2Member's options for *Alternative View Protection* which deals with search results and menus, as well as feeds.

## Page Access Restrictions

*Page Access Restrictions* work exactly like *Post Access Restrictions*. Here you can specify **Pages** restricted to certain *s2Member Levels*.

**What do I enter?** **Page IDs** in comma-delimited format. Example: `1,2,3,34,8,21`. Or, you can type `all` to protect all **Pages**.

![page-restrictions](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9320495/15324588/12dcc7a8-1c15-11e6-9f94-635cc5543bb8.jpg)

## Tag Access Restrictions

Here you can specify **Tags** restricted to certain *s2Member Levels*. When you restrict access to a **Tag Archive** it also restricts access to any **Post** having that **Tag** even if the **Post** has other **Tags**.

**Tip**: **Tags** can be applied to any **Post** without affecting your **Category** structure at all. If you'd like to use **Tags** with **Pages** get the [Tag Pages plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tag-pages/).

**What do I enter?** **Tags** in comma-delimited format. Example: `members`, `members only`, `free subscribers`, `premium`. Alternatively, you can type `all` to protect all **Tags**. 

**Note**: **Tags** are caSe sensitive. The **Tag** `members only` is **not** the same as `Members Only`.

![tag-restrictions](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9320495/15324605/2628cca8-1c15-11e6-971c-67ee55928e2c.jpg)

## Category Access Restrictions

Here you can specify **Categories** restricted to certain *s2Member  Levels*. **Category** restrictions are a bit more complex than the previous types of restrictions because **Categories** are *hierarchical*. 

When you restrict access to a **Category**, it also restricts access to any child **Categories** it may have. In other words, restricting a **Category** protects a **Category Archive**, all of its child **Category Archives**, and any **Posts** contained within the **Category** or its child **Categories**. Restricting access by **Category** is a very powerful form of protection, so please be careful. It is very easy to protect too much content by accident.

What do I enter? **Category IDs** in comma-delimited format. Example: `1,2,3,34,8,21`. Or, you can type `all` to protect all **Categories**.

![category-restrictions](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9320495/15324611/2c7fe7da-1c15-11e6-979a-1ca221349fc9.jpg)

Tip: Can't find your **Category IDs**? Get [WP Show IDs](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-show-ids/).

## URI Restrictions (Typical w/BuddyPress)

Here you can specify **URIs** (or word fragments found in **URIs**) restricted to certain *s2Member Levels*. Control over **URIs** is a little more complex than previous restrictions. *This section is for advanced webmasters only*. 

A **REQUEST_URI** is the portion of a **URL** that comes immediately after the domain. This is a **URL** - `http://www.example.com/path/to/file.php`, and this is the **URI -** `/path/to/file.php`. In other words, a **REQUEST_URI** is a full path to a real (or virtual) directory or file on your domain. *s2Member* can match a **URI** in whole, or in part.

What do I enter? You can provide a list of **URIs** (one per line; i.e., line-delimited) that should be off-limits based on *s2Member Level*. You can also use word fragments instead of a full **URI**. If a word fragment anywhere in the **URI** matches, it is protected. Wildcards and other regex patterns are not supported here, so you do not need to escape special characters or anything. 

Please note, depending on your caSe configuration option, your exclusion patterns might be caSe sensitive. If you choose to make these caSe sensitive, you must be specific. The word fragment `some-path/` would not match a **URI** that contains `some-Path/` if you enable case-sensitivity.

![uri-restriction-case-sensitive](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9320495/15324632/3d0482be-1c15-11e6-94e7-27ea6945dfd9.jpg)

**Replacement Codes**: You can use these *Replacement Codes* in *URI Restrictions*:

- `%%current_user_nicename%%` = The current User's **NiceName** in lowercase. The **Nicename** is a cleaner version of the **Username** for URLs. 
- `%%current_user_id%%` = The current User's **ID**. 
- `%%current_user_level%%` = The current User's *s2Member Level*. 
- `%%current_user_role%%` = The current User's *WordPress Role*. 
- `%%current_user_ccaps%%` = The current User's *Custom Capabilities*. 
- `%%current_user_logins%%` = The number of times the current User has logged in.

**BuddyPress (and similar plugins)**:  *URI Restrictions* work great with plugins like *BuddyPress* that add new areas to your site (where those new areas are not necessarily a **Post**/**Page**/**Tag**/**Category**). In other words, any time you'd like to protect a specific feature offered by *BuddyPress* (or other plugins), you'll need to nail down specific word fragments found in the **URIs** associated with those areas. For example, if you are using *BuddyPress* and want to protect *BuddyPress Groups*, you could add **URI** protection like this: `/members/%%current_user_nicename%%/groups`.

## Alternative View Protection (feeds, search results, etc...)

*s2Member* protects **Categories**, **Tags**, **Posts**, **Pages**, **Files**, **URI**s & more. However, even with all of those security restrictions, it is still possible for protected content excerpts to be seen through XML feeds, in search results generated by *WordPress*, and, depending on your theme, possibly in other *Archive* views. These might include  *Posts by Author*, *Posts by Date*, a list of featured items formulated by your theme or other plugins. We refer to all of these collectively, as *Alternative Views*.

You can tell *s2Member*  to protect these *Alternative Views* by filtering *WordPress* database queries for you. *s2Member* can automatically hide protected content that is not available to the current Member. In other words, *s2Member* is capable of pre-filtering all database queries so that excerpts of protected content do not slip through.

### Protect Alternative Views?

Select as many of the options in this list as you want or select *Filter ALL WordPress queries; protecting all Alternative Views*.

- **Searches** (prevent protected content from appearing in search results *generated by WordPress*, a theme, or a plugin) 
- **Feeds** (XML/RSS/ATOM feeds) 
- **Comment Feeds** (hide comments associated with protected content from comment feeds) 
- **Nav Menu**s (hide protected content in menus generated with **WordPress Dashboard → Appearance → Menus**) 
- **Pages** (hide protected content in widgets that list Pages)

![alternative-view-protection](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9320495/15324678/72d9a5fe-1c15-11e6-8206-6038ba298e69.jpg)

### For Developers

Filters can be suppressed dynamically using this technique:

- `query_posts()` - `("suppress_filters=true");`
- `get_posts()` - auto-suppresses filters

See [this article in the s2Member Codex](http://www.s2member.com/codex/stable/s2member/api_functions/package-functions/#src_doc_attach_s2member_query_filters()).

## Simple Shortcode Conditionals (protect only parts of your content)

*s2Member* makes it very easy to protect entire **Posts**, **Pages**, **Categories**, **Tags**, **URI**s, etc. Protecting this content can be accomplished here in your **WordPress Dashboard**, using one (or all) of the many tools available in the *s2Member* settings panels. Or, from the **Post**/**Page** editing panels in *WordPress*. We consider this to be point-and-click functionality—very easy.

However, *s2Member* also makes it possible for you to protect "parts" of a **Post** or **Page**. You can be creative about what you display to certain Users/Members, based on your custom criteria. *s2Member's* [Simple Shortcode Conditionals](http://s2member.com/kb-article/s2if-simple-shortcode-conditionals/) are the key to accomplishing this.

### Arbitrary PHP Code via [[s2If php=""]]

By default, the `[s2If]` Shortcode can be used only in a specific set of *Conditional Tags* provided by *WordPress* and the *s2Member* plugin. For example: `[s2If current_user_can(access_s2member_level1)]`. Arbitrary PHP code is not allowed with this syntax. However, it is possible to use arbitrary PHP code if you enable it in the drop-down under *Allow Arbitrary PHP Code via the `[s2If php=""]`*. 

![allow-arbitrary-php-code](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9320495/15324694/82e3ef54-1c15-11e6-8f80-926d193c1506.jpg)

This second syntax variation uses one PHP Shortcode Attribute to run a single conditional check. For example: `[s2If php="is_user_logged_in() && current_user_can('access_s2member_ccap_music')"]`. For developers, this has some obvious advantages. The code inside the PHP attribute is evaluated at runtime, so it is possible to accomplish more when necessary. You could also use a plugin like [ezPHP](http://s2member.com/kb-article/ezphp-for-wordpress/) to accomplish the same thing.

## Specific Post/Page Access Restrictions

*s2Member* supports an additional layer of functionality that allows you to sell access to specific **Posts** and **Pages** that you've created in *WordPress*.  *s2Member's Specific Post/Page Access* works independently of *Membership Level Access*. You can sell an unlimited number of **Posts** and **Pages** using *Buy Now* Buttons (or **Pro-Forms**; if you are running *s2Member Pro*) — your customers do not need a *Membership Account* on your site to receive access. If they are already a Member, that is fine, but they do not need to be.

In other words, customers do not need to log in to receive access to these specific **Posts** and **Pages**. *s2Member* immediately redirects the Customer to the correct **Post** or **Page** after checkout completes successfully. *s2Member* also sends an email to the Customer with a link (see: **WordPress Dashboard → s2Member → PayPal Options → Specific Post/Page Email**). If you are using a different payment gateway, simply substitute that name for *PayPal*. Authentication is handled automatically through self-expiring links that last for 72 hours by default.

*Specific Post/Page Access* is like selling a product. Instead of shipping anything to the Customer you just give them access to a specific **Post** or **Page** on your site. A specific **Post** or **Page** that is protected by 
*s2Member* might contain a download link for your eBook, access to file & music downloads, access to additional support services, or any number of things. The possibilities with this are virtually endless if you can deliver your digital product on a WordPress **Post** or **Page**.

All you do is protect the specific **Post** or **Page** **ID**s you are selling on your site. Then, you can go to **WordPress Dashboard → s2Member → PayPal Buttons → Specific Post/Page Restrictions** to generate *Buy Now* buttons that you can insert into your *WordPress Editor*. The **Button Generator** for *s2Member* will even let you package multiple **Posts** and **Pages** together into one transaction.

**What do I enter?** **Post** or **Page ID**s in comma-delimited format. Example: `1,2,3,34,8,21`. Note: the word `all` does **not** work here. You must supply a list of *Specific Post/Page IDs*.

**Avoid Conflicts!** \*Please be careful not to create a conflict with any of your other *Access Restrictions*. If you are going to sell *Specific Post/Page Access*, you should enter **Post** and **Page ID**s that are not already protected by other *Access Restrictions*, directly or indirectly.

In short, make sure that you have not protected any of your **Specific Posts/Pages** with *s2Member Level Access Restrictions* already. If you configure *s2Member* in such as a way, that a **Post** or **Page** requires both *s2Member Level Access* and *Specific Post/Page Access*, you create a conflict. Customers that purchase *Specific Post/Page Access* would be unable to access the **Post** or **Page** without also having a Membership.

## Brute Force IP/Login Restrictions

As with any authentication system, it is possible for someone to try and guess **Username** and **Password** combinations by attempting a *Brute Force Attack*: making repeated login attempts with various **Username** and **Password** combinations until the user or software program guesses correctly.

*s2Member* thwarts this behavior by monitoring failed login attempts occurring within a short period. Whenever *s2Member* detects an IP address (i.e., a remote user) consistently failing to enter a valid **Username** and **Password**, a temporary ban is created. This ban prevents additional attempts from taking place for 30 minutes. This temporary ban only affects the offending IP address.

**Note**: an empty IP address (associated with someone browsing anonymously) is also considered a unique IP address. This way anonymizers cannot circumvent *s2Member's* security.

### Maximum Failed Login Attempts:

Select the maximum number of failed login attempts from the drop-down box under **Maximum Failed Login Attempts**. When you change this value, you should also reset the brute force logs using the blue button at the top of this panel.

![brute-force-ip-protection](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9320495/15324715/8fab45de-1c15-11e6-8eca-ad3ce2f9370d.jpg)

## Unique IP Access Restrictions

As with any Membership system, it is possible for one Member to sign up and then share their login credentials with someone else or post it online for the whole world to see.  *s2Member's IP Restrictions* work for *s2Member Level Access* (i.e., account logins), *Specific Post/Page Access*, *Registration Links*, and other secure Entry Points. In all cases, the rules are simple. A single **Username**, **Access Link**, or **Entry Point** is only valid for a certain number of unique IP addresses.

Once a Member reaches the *Simultaneous Login* limit, *s2Member* assumes there has been a security breach. At that time, *s2Member* creates a temporary ban; preventing access to a *Specific Post/Page*, or to an account associated with a particular **Username**. This temporary ban only affects the offending **Link (Entry Point)** or **Username** related to the security breach. You can fine-tune this behavior using the options on this panel.

![unique-ip-protection](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9320495/15324737/9e1f303a-1c15-11e6-80c1-fa8435f2b7db.jpg)

**Note**: an empty IP address (associated with someone browsing anonymously) is also considered a unique IP address. This way anonymizers cannot circumvent *s2Member's* security.

**Note**:  This feature can work with or without *Simultaneous Login Monitoring* (*Simultaneous Login Monitoring* is an *s2Member Pro* feature). You can choose to implement *Unique IP Access Restrictions* and *Simultaneous Login Monitoring* together, just one of them, or neither. It is a matter of preference.

*Simultaneous Login Monitoring* has the added benefit of not being dependent upon IP address tracking—making it more user-friendly and reliable. This process is particularly helpful in cases where you'd like to support users who might travel a lot, have multiple devices, or be on ISPs that change their IP address frequently.

## Simultaneous Login Monitoring

*s2Member's Simultaneous Login Monitoring* (for *Membership Access* only) works with account logins (**Usernames**), to help you prevent a security issue. The rules are simple. A single **Username** can only have X number of simultaneous logins (as configured below). Once a Member reaches the *Simultaneous Login* limit, *s2Member* assumes there has been a security breach.

At that time, *s2Member* creates a temporary ban preventing the offending **Username** from being able to log in until somebody else logged into the account has logged-out.

*Simultaneous Login Monitoring* can be a tricky feature to configure because most people do not click a "**Logout**" link when they leave a website, making it hard to know when someone is still logged-in, and when they are not. *s2Member* monitors simultaneous logins by updating a timer whenever someone logs in and then again on each page view while they navigate the site.

If there is no activity within `X` amount of time, *s2Member's Simultaneous Login Monitor* considers that person inactive, and does not include them in security checks until they log in again or visit a new page on the site. You can configure the timeout period on this panel. The default value is 30 minutes.

![simultaneous-login-protection](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9320495/15324746/a6a8ef0c-1c15-11e6-9baf-74c109cd455c.jpg)

**Note**:  This feature can work with or without *Unique IP Restrictions*. You can choose to implement *Unique IP Access Restrictions* and *Simultaneous Login Monitoring* together, just one of them, or neither. It is a matter of preference.

*Simultaneous Login Monitoring* has the added benefit of not being dependent upon IP address tracking — making it more user-friendly and reliable. This process is particularly helpful in cases where you'd like to support users who might travel a lot, have multiple devices, or be on ISPs that change their IP address frequently.
