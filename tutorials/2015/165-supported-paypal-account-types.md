## PayPal Payments Standard

This is the default payment gateway in the free version of s2Member. We support "Buy Now" and "Subscriptions" (recurring and non-recurring) through PayPal Payments Standard. Available to merchants in [most countries](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/howto_product_matrix/).

## PayPal Website Payments Pro

s2Member Pro adds support for many other payment gateways, and PayPal Pro is included. See: [s2Member Features](http://s2member.com/features/) for more information. See also: [Product Availability](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/howto_product_matrix/) for PayPal's "Website Payments Pro" service. PayPal Pro requires a formal application and a small monthly fee.

Please see: [PayPal Website Payments Pro](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/paypal-payments-pro) for full details.

### s2Member Pro Supports two PayPal Pro Flavors

- [PayPal Website Payments Pro](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/paypal-payments-pro)
- and [PayPal Website Payments Pro (Payflow Edition)](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/products/ppp-payflow-edition/)

_**Note regarding Payflow stand-alone product:** s2Member Pro does **NOT** support Payflow as a stand-alone product. There is a difference. s2Member's support for Payflow is limited to "PayPal Website Payments Pro (Payflow Edition)"; where the Payflow "Edition" of PayPal Pro is now very common in newer PayPal Pro accounts; i.e., if you signup for [PayPal Website Payments Pro](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/paypal-payments-pro) today you will get the Payflow Edition automatically—and that's fine!_

_It's the [stand-alone Payflow Payment Gateway](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/payflow-payment-gateway) that we do not support._

_**Note regarding 'Hosted Solution':** s2Member Pro does **NOT** support Website Payments Pro as a 'Hosted Solution', which is a separate PayPal product with its own API. The Hosted Solution is designed to allow you to accept credit card payments on PayPal's website, not on your website using something like s2Member Pro. If you signup for [PayPal Website Payments Pro](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/paypal-payments-pro) (not the Hosted Solution variation), that will work just fine with s2Member Pro._

_It's the [Website Payments Pro 'Hosted Solution'](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/products/website-payments-pro-hosted-solution/) that we do not support._
